Sburb is Skaia's game, they need to escape Skaia's tendrils, Skaia chose to manipulate its defense portals. Maybe I'm over thinking this, but what is skaia? there seem to be four entities which embody the aspects. LE is time, Calliope is space, the NCoHTs is void, and skaia is light. We know where calliope and caliborn come from, and there are a million theories about the origins of the NCoHTs, but nobody thinks about what skaia is? they treat it as intelligent, malevolent even. The different skaias all seem to share some sort of hive mind, or are aspects of some primordial force of light.

|The source of Skaia................... is a complete unknown. It would be like asking, who coded Sburb? For all we know, it could have appeared out of the void.| normal
|The only thing we know about it is that it is omniscient and without bias. It has no malevolence, it simply knows what will be, even if that thing is terrible. It is, as far as we know, a distinct entity from Paradox Space, but because it is omniscient and without bias, and because Paradox Space is a force of nature like gravity, then the two go together. All Skaia is doing is showing the inevitabilities that are caused through Paradox Space in its attempts to keep existence paradox free.| normal

|rose and many other cerebral characters seem to attach sentience to skaia when they describe it. Sburb is Skaia's game, they need to escape Skaia's tendrils, Skaia chose to manipulate its defense portals. Maybe I'm over thinking this, but what is skaia? there seem to be four entities which embody the aspects. LE is time, Calliope is space, the NCoHTs is void, and skaia is light. We know where calliope and caliborn come from, and there are a million theories about the origins of the NCoHTs, but nobody thinks about what skaia is? they treat it as intelligent, malevolent even. The different skaias all seem to share some sort of hive mind, or are aspects of some primordial force of light. I want to understand, because after reading that gnosticism thing, I'm starting to understand that skaia is as much a villain as LE is| normal

|Yeah, things that have already happened from their perspective, but things they're still able to influence due to the causal clusterfuck nature of the events, things they must influence but would otherwise have ignored if they hadn't seen it in a cloud.

Maybe I'm over thinking this, but what is skaia? there seem to be four entities which embody the aspects. LE is time, Calliope is space, the NCoHTs is void, and skaia is light. We know where calliope and caliborn come from, and there are a million theories about the origins of the NCoHTs, but nobody thinks about what skaia is? they treat it as intelligent, malevolent even. The different skaias all seem to share some sort of hive mind, or are aspects of some primordial force of light.

|Draconian Dignitary dons the Ring of Orbs Nofold and is immediately hit with a surge of overwhelming power that drops him to his knees. A bright light emanates from DD as every fiber of his body pulsates with pure energy. We are witnessing an incredible metamorphosis taking place here people! The Dignitary transforms into none other than... the Dignitary! What, were you expecting him to grow tentacles and wings or something? Come on son, that shit is so ridiculous and would be just like school in summer time. NO CLASS!| normal

|John hops down through the hole in the bathroom floor and finds himself in the utility room down below where he successfully sticks his landing. He picks up the nearby sledgehammer and captchalogue card, combines the two and proceeds to apply it to his strife specibus. Now that's some heavy duty firepower. It appears a chum is calling on the PDA. John answers gardenGnostic who inquire about the package she sent him for his birthday. Their conversation is interrupted when a loud explosion rocks GG's home. While she heads out to investigate, John enters the living room and examines the cruxtruder which seems to be blocking the main door. TT accidentally rips the bathtub right out of its piping just like the toilet. "Oh fuck" is right. What a mess!| normal

|How do you mean? There have been visions of things that happened in the past in the clouds. Like in [S] Jade: Pester John she saw Bec's meteor land and I think Rose and Dave's houses in winter (on the days John's birthday presents reached them and they got trolled).| normal
|But I think she (or Kanaya, or both) also mentioned how Skaia seemed to show them just what they needed to know. Or maybe that's just what it seems like from their perspective. It's one of those things that's a big ontological fucktangle when you start examining it.| normal

|Yeah, things that have already happened from their perspective, but things they're still able to influence due to the causal clusterfuck nature of the events, things they must influence but would otherwise have ignored if they hadn't seen it in a cloud. Maybe Skaia isn't showing them these things, maybe it just radiates the information all at once and it's a trick of refraction through the clouds that produces clear isolated images, I'm just saying it looks eerily like Jade's being directly manipulated sometimes.| normal
