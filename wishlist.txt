add replay to re-listen to the last voice
add slowdown and playback speed change options
run the thing as daemon. figure out how to do that reasonably
play a nice low tone as a post seperator when there are more than three of them or so
add actual decent update checking. none of this rebuilding the entire thread stuff
building on the last note, change the data structure to a per-post list, so we get replay more easily, as well as history browsing and voice change.

more ambitious:
change the thing to a lightweight multithreaded producer-consumer model.
